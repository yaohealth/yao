        <h1>COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE</h1>
        <p>
          Complementary and alternative Medicine, is defined by NCIB, by using one of the most widely used
          classification structures, developed by <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK83804/">NCCAM (2000)</a>,
          divides CAM modalities into five categories:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Alternative medical systems,</li>
          <li>Mind-body interventions,</li>
          <li>Biologically based treatments,</li>
          <li>Manipulative and body-based methods, and</li>
          <li>Energy therapies.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          As the name implies, alternative medical systems is a category that extends beyond a single modality, and
          refers to an entire system of theory and practice that developed separately from conventional medicine.
          Examples of these systems include traditional Chinese medicine, ayurvedic medicine, homeopathy, and naturopathy.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second category in the NCCAM classification scheme is mind-body interventions, which include practices
          that are based on the human mind, but that have an effect on the human body and physical health, such as
          meditation, prayer, and mental healing.
        </p>
        <p>
          The third category, biologically based therapies, includes specialized diets, herbal products, and other natural
          products such as minerals, hormones, and biologicals. Specialized diets include those proposed by Drs. Atkins
          and Ornish, as well as the broader field of functional foods that may reduce the risk of disease or promote health.
          A few of the well-known herbals for which there is evidence of effectiveness include St. John's wort for the
          treatment of mild to moderate depression and Ginkgo biloba for the treatment of mild cognitive impairment. An
          example of a nonherbal natural product is fish oil for the treatment of cardiovascular conditions.
        </p>
        <p>
          The fourth category, manipulative and body-based methods, includes therapies that involve movement or manipulation
          of the body. Chiropractic is the best known in this category, and chiropractors are licensed to practice in
          every U.S. state. A defining feature of chiropractic treatment is spinal manipulation, also known as spinal
          adjustment, to correct spinal joint abnormalities <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK83804/">(Meeker and Haldeman, 2002)</a>.
          Massage therapy is another example of a body-based therapy.
        </p>
        <p>
          The final category described by NCCAM is energy therapies which include the manipulation and application of
          energy fields to the body. In addition to electromagnetic fields outside of the body, it is hypothesized that
          energy fields exist within the body. The existence of these biofields has not been experimentally proven;
          however, a number of therapies include them, such as qi gong, Reiki, and therapeutic touch.
        </p>
        <p>
          As former director-General of WHO, DR. Margaret Chan, said “The two systems of traditional and Western medicine
          need not clash. Within the context of primary health care, they can blend together in a beneficial harmony”,
          all the more so that CAM, based on the WHO Traditional Medicine strategy Report 2014-2023, “has proven good
          results cost wise compared to conventional medicine, especially for manual medicine”.
        </p>
        <h2>Acupuncture</h2>
        <p>
          Acupuncture is perhaps the best-known aspect of traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) in the west. It aims to
          influence body functions and stimulate and restore the body’s own regulatory system by using specific (acupuncture) points
          on the surface of the body. Besides the use of needles, the application of pressure(acupressure) and heat
          (moxibustion) are also traditionally used. Diagnosis and treatment are conducted in accordance with the
          presenting individual pattern of disharmony and are based on traditional concepts, centuries of clinical
          experience and on modern scientific basic research. Acupuncture can treat a wide range
          of complaints both organic and functional in origin. It is also well known for its
          application in pain management and modern research has confirmed its effectiveness in the treatment of low
          back pain, depression, the treatment of migraine
          and many other common conditions. Acupuncture can be combined with
          other therapeutic TCM techniques such as moxibustion, cupping, gua sha (a kind
          of rubbing therapy), herbs, dietetics, tuina (massage and manual therapy) and
          qigong (exercises, breathing, concentration). Acupuncture is often integrated in
          various therapeutic aspects of mainstream medicine.
        </p>
        <h2>Chiropractic</h2>
        <p>
          Chiropractic is a healthcare profession that focuses on disorders of the musculoskeletal system and the
          nervous system, and the effects of these disorders on general health. Chiropractic care is used most often
          to treat neuromusculoskeletal complaints, including but not limited to back pain, neck pain, pain in the joints
          of the arms or legs, and headaches. Chiropractic physicians or chiropractors practise a hands-on approach to
          healthcare that includes patient examination, diagnosis and treatment. They have broad diagnostic skills and
          are also trained to recommend therapeutic and rehabilitative exercises, as well as to provide nutritional,
          dietary and lifestyle counselling.
        </p>
        <h2>Herbal Medicine</h2>
        <p>
          Herbal medicine – also called phytomedicine or phytotherapy – refers to using a plant’s seeds, berries, roots,
          leaves, bark, or flowers for medicinal purposes. Whole herbs contain many chemical constituents working
          synergistically together to treat disease and support the body’s own healing mechanisms (e.g. its immunity).
          Herbal medicine practice is rooted in hundreds of years of experience of using plant medicines which today is
          underpinned by the scientific study (pharmacognosy) of plant medicines and their chemical constituents. Herbal
          medicine is becoming mainstream as improvements in analysis and quality control along with advances in clinical
          research show the value of plant medicines in the treatment and prevention of disease Apart from the herbal
          medicine itself, herbal practitioners will routinely offer advice on appropriate changes of lifestyle, diet
          and the adoption of stress-reduction techniques and exercise.
        </p>
        <h2>Homeopathic Medicine</h2>
        <p>
          Homeopathy is a whole medical system that originated in Germany. The fundamental idea of homeopathy is the
          Similarity Principle, which implies that substances capable of causing disorder in healthy subjects are used
          as medicines to treat similar patterns of disorder experienced by ill people. Homeopathic medicines are aimed
          to direct and stimulate the body’s self-regulatory mechanisms. Homeopathy is highly individualized while
          taking into account the symptoms and signs of the disease, the patient’s physical build, personality,
          temperament and genetic predispositions. Apart from homeopathic medication, advice on change of lifestyle,
          diet and substance-abuse behaviors, acquisition of stress-reduction techniques and exercise are part of the package of care.
        </p>
        <h2>Naturopathic or Traditional European Medicine (TEM&N)</h2>
        <p>
          Rooted in Hippocratic, Mediterranean and middle-European traditional healing systems, TEM&N currently
          represents a pragmatic blend of traditional, scientific and empirical methods in the prevention and treatment
          of illness and the maintenance of health. The principles and methods of TEM&N are taught so they can be adopted
          and practiced by those seeking better health or health maintenance. The principles involved include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Understanding the human being as an integral part of nature achieving optimum health by having body,
            mind and spirit in harmony with the environment.
          </li>
          <li>
            Understanding and employing the inherent homeostatic and regulatory principles of the body’s biological
            and biochemical and electromagnetic functions.
          </li>
          <li>
            Understanding the central importance of the interplay of the elements, temperament and constitution so that
            treatment is suited to individual need.
          </li>
          <li>
            Making an individual diagnosis based on the unique analysis of each case.
          </li>
          <li>
            Highlighting the necessary measures to achieve full health and prevention of disease. This includes
            appropriate individualized dietary and lifestyle advice suited to the specific individual. TEM&N is a
            distinct healthcare profession, emphasizing the importance of prevention as well as offering treatment
            through the use of a variety of therapeutic methods and natural substances that encourage individuals’
            inherent self-healing eliminative and constructive processes to obtain optimum health. TEM&N professionals
            comprehend human beings and other living creatures as a vital individual unity of body, soul and spirit..
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Osteopathy</h2>
        <p>
          Osteopathy is a system of medicine that emphasizes the theory that the body can heal itself given normal,
          healthy structural relationships, environmental conditions, and nutrition. Treatment attends to body mechanics
          and manipulative methods in diagnosis and therapy. It is a contact and patient-centered healthcare discipline,
          that emphasizes the interrelationship of structure and function of the body, facilitates the body’s innate
          ability to heal itself and supports a whole-person approach to all aspects of health and healthy development,
          principally through manual treatment. The practice of osteopathy uses current medical and scientific knowledge
          to apply the principles of osteopathy to patient care. Scientific plausibility and evidence-based outcomes have
          a high priority in patient treatment and case management. Osteopathy provides a broad range of approaches to
          the maintenance of health and the management of disease. It embraces the concept of the unity of the
          individual’s structure (anatomy) and function (physiology); as such osteopathy is a patient-centered rather
          than disease-centered system of healthcare. An essential component of osteopathy is its great attention to
          body mechanics and its manual methods in diagnosis and therapy. Osteopathy was developed as a means to
          facilitate normal self-regulating/self-healing mechanisms in the body by addressing areas of tissue strain,
          stress or dysfunction which may impede normal neural, vascular and biochemical mechanisms.
        </p>
        <h2>Reflexology</h2>
        <p>
          Reflexology is the study and practice of treating points and areas in the feet and hands that relate to
          corresponding parts of the body. Using precise hand and finger techniques, a reflexologist may improve
          circulation, induce relaxation and enable homeostasis. This encourages the person’s own healing systems to be
          activated to maintain wellbeing. Reflexology has been practiced for over 4000 years, its practice dates back
          to Ancient Egypt, India and China. It was introduced to the West by a surgeon, Dr William Fitzgerald, who
          published an article in 1917 on Zone Therapy or Relieving Pain at Home. In the 1930’s a physiotherapist,
          Eunice Ingham, further developed his theory which become known as reflexology. Reflexology is a holistic
          treatment tailored to the individual that can be received by anyone at any age, from newborn babies to the
          elderly, although there may be times when it is not a suitable treatment. Reflexology is often used alongside
          allopathic healthcare to increase health and wellbeing. Professional reflexologists do not claim to cure,
          diagnose or prescribe.
        </p>
        <h2>Shiatsu</h2>
        <p>
          Shiatsu is an autonomous natural healthcare system which originated in Japan, and is influenced by traditional
          Chinese medicine and more recently Western knowledge. It derives its theoretical and practical roots from the
          ancient traditions of East Asian philosophies and healing and the holistic understanding of life and health
          based upon them. Its aim is to stimulate and support the processes of natural self-healing, well-being and
          personal growth, and to maintain health, through balancing the energetic system of a person. The method uses
          the application of pressure or energetic touch on specific points, channels (meridians) or areas of the body
          to balance the circulation of the body’s energy (Ki in Japanese or Qi in Chinese). Treatment involves brief or
          sustained pressure with thumbs, hands, elbows, knees and feet to meridians and tsubo (pressure points) and to
          other physical structures. Treatment may also include rotations and stretching of limbs, joints and meridians.
          Shiatsu is usually given on a soft mat on the floor. Shiatsu enhances self-awareness and sensitivity, and
          releases tension. It also supports and nourishes a person’s life-force. Applied by a practitioner with appropriate
          training, shiatsu promotes general well being and can be used as a preventative healthcare method. It can also
          assist people through crisis, difficult life phases and processes of change. It can treat people presenting
          with a wide variety of physical conditions.
        </p>
        <h2>Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)</h2>
        <p>
          Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) originated in ancient China and has evolved over thousands of years. It
          encompasses many different practices, including acupuncture, moxibustion (burning an herb above the skin to
          apply heat to acupuncture points), Chinese herbal medicine, tuina (Chinese therapeutic massage), gua sha
          (a rubbing therapy), dietary therapy, and tai chi and qigong (practices that combine specific movements or
          postures, coordinated breathing, and mental focus). Traditional Chinese medicine dates back more than 2,500
          years. Traditional systems of medicine also exist in other East and South Asian countries, including Japan
          (where the traditional herbal medicine is called Kampo) and Korea. Some of these systems have been influenced
          by TCM and are similar to it, but each has developed distinctive features of its own.
        </p>
        <h2>Yoga</h2>
        <p>
          Yoga is a systematic practice of physical exercise, breath control, relaxation, diet control, positive thinking
          and meditation aimed at developing harmony in the body, mind, and environment. The practice entails low-impact
          physical activity, postures (called asanas), breathing techniques (pranayama), relaxation, and meditation.
          Yoga is an ancient system of physical and mental practices that originated during the Indus Valley civilization
          in South Asia. The fundamental purpose of yoga is to foster harmony in the body, mind, and environment. The
          origin of the word ‘Yoga’ is a Sanskrit word Yog meaning ‘union’. Yoga is a union of the organ systems in the
          body with the consciousness in the mind. Yoga is a low-cost self-help approach to well-being. Regular practice
          of yoga can lead to reduced stress levels, improved flexibility and muscle strength, improved posture, improved
          awareness of the physical body and the self. As it is not necessary to be in peak physical condition to
          practice yoga, it is an ideal activity for sedentary people and for seniors as well as for those who are
          more active.
